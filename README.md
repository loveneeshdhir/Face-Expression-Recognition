# Face-Expression-Recognition

OpenCV/DL based project. The goal is to classify each facial image into one of the seven facial emotion categories considered .

## Data :
We trained and tested our models on the data set from the [Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data), which comprises 48-by-48-pixel grayscale images of human faces,each labeled with one of 7 emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral .

Image set of 35,887 examples, with training-set : dev-set: test-set as 80 : 10 : 10 .

## Getting started

To run the code :
1. Download FER2013 dataset from [Kaggle Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge) and extract in the main folder.
2. Then run code.py  
3. After that run video.py    
(Have provided the pre-trained model with an accuracy of 78.64%)
